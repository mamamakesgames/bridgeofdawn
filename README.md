# Bridge of Dawn

*Bridge of Dawn* is a free, open-sourced 3D arcade/racing style game for Windows, OS X, and Linux. It is being created for 2021 Epic MegaJam by an all-female team from [Mama Makes Games](https://www.mamamakesgames.com): [Kimberly Blais](https://www.instagram.com/mamamakesgames/) is doing the game's design, development, and art; [Erica Schroeder](https://www.ericaschroeder.com/) performed the voice acting; and Madame X is composing the game's music.

The source code and Unreal Engine 4 project for this game is available for free under the MIT Open Source license here at GitHub. You can download this project to learn how the game was made, make any changes you'd like, and then release your own version of the game! Just install [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com), clone this repository, and open the `BridgeOfDawn_UEProj.uproject` file to get started. If you're comfortable sharing, I'd love to know what you make with it, so send me an email at kim@mamamakesgames.com or let me know on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mamamakesgames/) with #bridgeofdawn.
